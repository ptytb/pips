## todo


- [X] Save user env list
- [X] Add search with Github API
- [X] Add editable packages to Install dialog (git, local); pip list --editable; Appropriate checkbox is still needed in the install dialog
- [ ] Mistype verification with Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance (fuzzy). As PowerShell v3 is JIT-compiled, no need for external DLLs
- [ ] GPG signature verification for packages (with gpg.exe)
- [ ] Add some integration with VirusTotal (sha-256 of archive + link to VT for a starter)
- [ ] Fix "isolated" checkbox behavior is somewhat uncertain
- [ ] Move known package index builder code into the main script
- [ ] Sort by Popularity, Downloads, ...
- [ ] Add package name to JobName to prevent repeating requests already being queried
- [ ] search through PyDoc browser
- [ ] Verbosity control (-v, -vv, -vvv) for pip, a combobox over the log pane
- [X] Filter modes: Whole, And, Or, Regexp (RegExp seems feasible with Linq, but a little quirky)
- [X] Fix peps url 0000 numbering
- [X] Install packages dialog like in R Studio (with package name completion)
- [ ] PyDoc and PyPi meta-info mirror local indexing and searching (binary indeces are too big, separated repo needed or even *git lfs*)
- [X] Now assuming *utf-8* for IO whilst old(?) Python versions use cp1252, which generates empty strings for Chinese, Russian, etc.
- [ ] Filter package search results for conda by relevant Architecture
- [ ] Implement some missing conda commands
- [ ] *conda* command has a nice options to work with but gives wierd output - suggests older package versions than installed. Needed intervention with channels?
- [ ] conda activate & conda env creation
- [ ] Provide conda patcher (conda from PyPI is deliberately broken by devs by means of changing entrypoints to "warning stub"). Conda is under *BSD 3-Clause License* -> sounds legit.
